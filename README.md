Approximate Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning - Programming Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to implement a simple environment and learn to make optimal decisions inside a maze by solving the problem with Dynamic Programming. Value Iteration(VI) and Policy Iteration(PI) i.e. Policy Evaluation, Policy Improvement methods are implemented and analyzed.

Run the `python main.py /absolute/path/to/maze.txt` command to launch the application.
